# Level Up

Level Up is an application that turns exercise into a video game. Users can choose between push-ups, sit-ups and squats and have their form analyzed and reps counted through pose estimation.

Choose between 2 game modes.

Infinite: Unlock your potential by exercising to your limit, while having your reps counted automatically

Progress: Set a goal for yourself and have your progress displayed on the screen in the form of a progress bar
